# **PUT request:**

A `PUT request is another HTTP request method, similar to GET and POST, but with a different purpose.`

In a `PUT request, the client sends data to the server to update or replace a resource at a specific URL.` This means that the client is requesting to store or update the resource's state with the provided data. Unlike POST requests, which are often used to create new resources, PUT requests are typically used to update existing ones.

PUT requests are idempotent, meaning that making the same PUT request multiple times should have the same effect as making it once. This is because the intention of a PUT request is to set the state of the resource to the provided data, regardless of its current state.
