# **GET request:**

When a client sends a `GET request to a server`, it is asking the server to send back a resource. This request method is typically used for retrieving data from the server. 

`GET requests can be seen in the URL of a webpage`, such as when you type a website address into your browser's address bar. GET requests can send a limited amount of data, usually through query parameters appended to the URL.
