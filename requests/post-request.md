# **POST request:**

On the other hand, `when a client sends a POST request to a server`, it is asking the server to accept and store the data enclosed in the request. `This method is often used when submitting forms or sending data that needs to be processed by the server`.

`Unlike GET requests, POST requests can send a larger amount of data and are not restricted by URL length limitations`. The data is sent in the body of the request, rather than as part of the URL.
