Welcome to this repository! Here, I've provided a simplified introduction to FastAPI, a powerful web framework for building APIs with Python. While this repository covers fundamental concepts, it's important to note that FastAPI offers much more depth and complexity than what's included here.

# **What is FastAPI**

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It's designed to be easy to use, intuitive, and highly efficient.

# **What Does This Repository Cover**

In this repository, I've outlined the basic essentials to help you kickstart your journey with FastAPI. You'll find explanations and examples that demonstrate how to create routes, handle requests, and leverage FastAPI's features effectively.
